# cheat-sheets

## A collection of knowledge snippets I've accumulated over time

This Repository of **Cheat-Sheets** is my personal collection/knowledge-base accumualted during my work & play activities. It's an eclectic collection of hints/tips, code-snippets, technical documentation, and command reference for various tools & technologies that I've encountered during those activities.

> :warning: Be aware, products can, and often do, change over time. Whilst I endeavour to keep these up to date (because my memory isn't what it used to be) I make no guarantees whatsoever that this is always achieved.  Therefore please use at your own risk - but hey you wouldn't implicitly trust some random guy on the internet without a little research of your own now, would you?
